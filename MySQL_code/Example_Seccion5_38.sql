-- BUSINESS CONTEXT: we want to see landing page performance for a certain time period

-- STEP 1: find the first website_pageview_id for relevant sessions
-- STEP 2: identify the landing page of each session
-- STEP 3: counting pageviews for each session, to identify "bounces"
-- STEP 4: summarizing total sessions and bounced sessions, by LP

-- finding the minimum website pageview id associated with each session we care about
