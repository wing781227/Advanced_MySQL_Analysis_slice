-- Demo on Building Conversion Funnels

-- BUSINESS CONTEXT
	-- we want to build a mini conversion funnel, from /lander-2 to /cart
    -- we want to know how many people reach each step, and also dropoff rates
    -- for simplicity of the demo, we're looking at /lander-2 traffic only
    -- for simplicity of the demo, we're looking at customers who like Mr Fuzzy only
    
-- STEP 1: select all pageviews for relevant sessions
-- STEP 2: identify each relevant pageview as the specific funnel step
-- STEP 3: create the session-level conversion funnel view
-- STEP 4: aggregate the data to assess funnel performance

-- first I will show you all of the pageviews we care about
-- then, I will remove the comments from my flag columns one by one to show you what that looks like
